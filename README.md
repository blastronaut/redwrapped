**RedWrapped**

RedWrapped is a local-first “Wrapped-style” dashboard for your Reddit account. It helps you explore your own activity over time—top communities by year, posting/commenting trends, and a personal rediscovery feed—without shipping your data to a third-party server.

RedWrapped runs on your machine, authenticates via your Reddit OAuth, and only accesses what’s needed to generate your private recap.

What it does

📈 Year-by-year summaries of your activity (posts, comments, saved, upvoted—where available)

🧭 “Rediscover” old posts/comments you forgot existed

🧹 Optional self-cleanup tools to delete your own posts/comments (with explicit confirmation)

Privacy & safety

✅ Local processing by default (no third-party analytics or remote storage)

✅ No inference of sensitive traits, no re-identification, no off-platform matching

✅ No use of Reddit data to train ML/AI models

If you want, I can also write:

a one-paragraph short tagline (for the repo description),

a “How it works” section that lists endpoints/scopes at a high level (good for API review),

and a Privacy Policy markdown file that matches Reddit’s disclosure expectations. (Reddit Data API Terms
